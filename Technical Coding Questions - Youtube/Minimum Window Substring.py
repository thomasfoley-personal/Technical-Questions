"""
Problem Statement:
Given two strings s and t, find the shortest substring of s that contains all characters of t. If substring does not
exist, return an empty string
"""
"""
Initial Thoughts: 
Edge case = test if t even is contained by s
shortest substring = len(t)
can put t into set?
"""
"""
Video Thoughts:
Check frequencies of s and t, if s has smaller frequency for any letter, then false, otherwise true
